		<p class="bio__blurb">An inspired new web developer, capable with .NET, WordPress, and cross-browser development. I love UI/UX, SASS, and responsive design. I believe a less-is-more approach in both code and design leads to more maintainable code.</p>

			<h3 class="box__header">What Skills Do I Have?</h3>
			<p class="box__body">
				Having worked in retail I've learned how to work both independently and together. Independently, I learned how to manage work-flow, as in planning goals, prioritizing them, and then just working my butt off to accomplish them. Working as a team, I learned how to be a great team member. The most important part of being a great member team is having each others backs and lending a helping hand to one another. The ability to handle pressure is another skill that I picked up in retail, mostly from running multiple departments Individually. I often would work multiple positions, but in the process I learned how to be adaptive, and adjust to a new environment. Being able to self-teach is amazing and I know how to self-teach. Due to this skill I have picked up multiple things from learning the .NET framework to making hard candy. From being a frequent User of the web I have picked up how important users experience is and learned to make user-friendly sites. 
				<br><br>
				In addition to these skills, I also bring my tool bag of technical skills to the table. These include proficiencies with HTML5, CSS3, scripting in PHP, Sass, and responsive web design. This is a small snapshot of my list of ever-growing skills, for further reference see the attached resume.

			<h3 class="box__header">What Do I Do?</h3>
			<p class="box__body">
				While I'm not working I, of course, have leisure time and cannot stand doing absolutely nothing. So, with my leisure time I discover new music, play video games, learn more about science, draw, watch documentaries or films, bowl, go camping, bake candy, and enjoy the company of my friends. Many hobbies I want to learn moving forward include learning the guitar, and speaking Swedish but, one can only seize one day at a time.

			<h3 class="box__header">Why Me?</h3>
			<p class="box__body">
				So why am I a good fit? Well for one I'm a tinkerer, someone who can intuitively dissect an idea or technology to find what makes it tick. This mind-set has always helped me understand the inner workings of things, and aids in solving new problems. I am eager to work with a team, embrace new ideas, and expand my expertise. I'm Adaptable under pressure, whether it be a fast approaching deadline or meeting a fundamental change to a project. Willing to put forth the effort, give help to others along the way, and I have the ability to learn quickly and innovate.
