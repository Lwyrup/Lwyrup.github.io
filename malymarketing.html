	<div class="bio l-bio">
		<p class="bio__blurb">A inspired new web developer, capable in both the front and back end of development, and naturally curious. I absolutely love regular expressions, Sass, learning new things, and animation. I believe a less-is-more approach in both code and design leads to more legible code and a user-friendly experience.</p>

			<p class="box__body">
				Going into my first position in sale I was a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, I was carved out of wood. I learned how important the customer's experience is and this is evident in creating websites. If it takes too long, they get upset and leave. If they can't find something they leave again. On the web, this bad design can actually lose money. I ensured that clients got the help they needed and did so quickly. I also credit my steady-under-pressure adaptiveness to my position in sales. All the times we ended up under staffed, I ended up covering multiple positions and coordinating with other associates to ensure service to clients. Working in that position taught me how to manage high workloads, work with a team, and how to adapt to fit a projects needs.
				<br><br>
				In addition to these work-flow skills, I also bring my tool bag of technical skills to the table. These include proficiencies with HTML5, CSS3, scripting in PHP, Sass, and responsive web design. This is a small snapshot of my list of ever-growing skills, for further reference see the attached resume.

			<h3 class="box__header">What Do I Do?</h3>
			<p class="box__body">
				While I'm not working I, of course, have leisure time and cannot stand doing absolutely nothing. So, with my leisure time I discover new music, play video games, learn more about science, draw, watch documentaries or films, bowl, go camping, bake candy, and enjoy the company of my friends. Many hobbies I want to learn moving forward include learning the guitar, and speaking Swedish but, one can only seize one day at a time.

			<h3 class="box__header">Why Maly Marketing?</h3>
			<p class="box__body">
				I love that you get to sell fun and adventure! Well sure people say the Midwest is boring but, I say there just not well publicized yet. It's also great to see that you help out the smaller businesses and in turn breed more jobs. There also seems to be a healthy work environment that is very appealing and accommodating unlike the standard oppressive environment. You also understand the importance of openness and fun that I believe are a must for great working conditions. Most of all you understand that the Internet is an important and near essential platform for business to utilize in the current age, especially considering each day Google handles over three billion search queries per day.

			<h3 class="box__header">Why Me?</h3>
			<p class="box__body">
				So why exactly am I a good fit for you? For starters you need someone who can solve problems and adapt to ever-changing circumstances. This person also is a devout worker who can discern what makes a great design. Under high pressures you will find diamonds and this person. Someone who know what goes into creating a website and can execute the steps. They also will be able to work within a group to achieve the common goal. That diamond is me.
