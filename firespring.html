	<div class="bio l-bio">
		<p class="bio__blurb">An inspired new web developer, capable in both the front and back-end of development, and naturally curious. I absolutely love regular expressions, Sass, learning new things, and animation. I believe a less-is-more approach in both code and design leads to more legible code and a user-friendly experience.</p>

				Going into my first position in sale I was a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, I was carved out of wood. I learned how important the customer's experience is and this is evident in creating websites. If it takes too long, they get upset and leave. If they can't find something they leave again. On the web, this bad design can actually lose money. I ensured that clients got the help they needed and did so quickly. I also credit my steady-under-pressure adaptiveness to my position in sales. All the times we ended up under staffed, I ended up covering multiple positions and coordinating with other associates to ensure service to clients. Working in that position taught me how to manage high workloads, work with a team, and how to adapt to fit a projects needs.
				<br><br>
				In addition to these work-flow skills, I also bring my tool bag of technical skills to the table. These include proficiencies with HTML5, CSS3, scripting in PHP, Sass, and responsive web design. This is a small snapshot of my list of ever-growing skills, for further reference see the attached resume.

			<h3 class="box__header">What Do I Do?</h3>
			<p class="box__body">
				While I'm not working I, of course, have leisure time and cannot stand doing absolutely nothing. So, with my leisure time I discover new music, play video games, learn more about science, draw, watch documentaries or films, bowl, go camping, bake candy, and enjoy the company of my friends. Many hobbies I want to learn moving forward include learning the guitar, and speaking Swedish but, one can only seize one day at a time.

			<h3 class="box__header">Why Firespring?</h3>
			<p class="box__body">
				I love the way you approach business! Breaking the monotonous 9 to 5 corporate suited robot approach and instead adopting a more human style; with a casual dress code and more than just work. Being part of Firespring is not just a job, you become part of a large family. The largest in the Midwest as far as marketing communication firms go.You give back to the community, help non-profits, volunteer, and use your power for good. You genuinely care for both the community and your clients.Due to this care you have earned a B corporation certification, the first in Nebraska! That is amazing and hopefully helps others follow in your footsteps.All the way back in 1992 you realized the web was growing, and began to evolve, adapt, and utilize this great tool. You realized the web could be a huge platform for businesses and were willing to adapt and develop using it.Most of all though, you understand work should be fun! It's not just cubicles and boardrooms.

			<h3 class="box__header">Why Me?</h3>
			<p class="box__body">
				So why am I a good fit? Well for one I'm a tinkerer, someone who can intuitively dissect an idea or technology to find what makes it tick. This mind-set has always helped me understand the inner workings of things, and aids in solving new problems. Just as in biology, tech is always evolving, and for that reason I embrace new progressive ideas and practices. I am adaptable under pressure, whether it be a fast approaching deadline or meeting a fundamental change to a project. When I see something that could be improved, like a design choice that affects the user's experience, I am not afraid to discuss it. Such flaws lower the overall quality, and I like to ensure the quality soars sky-high.
